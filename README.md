## Rockerbuster Market Analysis
This project covers a market analysis conducted on helaf og Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company. Rockbuster is looking to break into online movie streming servies using its exisiting movie licenses. I worked as a data analyst with business intellegence department to help with the launch strategy for the new service. 

Through this task, I referenced a star schema database comprised of tables containing customer, geographic, product, and purchse information. I used various SQL queries, including CRUD operations, joining tables, and creating VIEWs and CTEs, to answer the following key questions:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was teh average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are custoemrs with higher lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
