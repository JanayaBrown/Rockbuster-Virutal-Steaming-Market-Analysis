# Data Cleansing 

The following queries are to for cleaning databases. They cover checking for and rectifying duplicate, non-uniform, and missing data.


### Duplicate Data
/* checking for duplicated in the film table */ 
SELECT title,
       release_year,
       language_id,
       rental_duration,
       COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY title,
         release_year,
         language_id,
         rental_duration
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;



/* template to create a view with unique values */
CREATE VIEW film_view AS
SELECT film_id, 
       title,
       release_year,
       language_id,
       rental_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id, 
       title,
       release_year,
       language_id,
       rental_duration



/* template to delete duplicate records */
DELETE
FROM film
WHERE film_id NOT IN
    (SELECT MIN(film_id)
     FROM film_view
     GROUP BY film_id, 
       title,
       release_year,
       language_id,
       rental_duration



### Non-uniform Data
/* checking for non_uniform data in the customer tab;e */ 
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM customer

/* Replacing “column_name” with the column in question and adding */

WHERE email NOT LIKE ‘%@% 
OR email NOT LIKE ‘%.%’ 
/* to check for proper formatting for the email */ 



/* template to correct non-uniform data */
UPDATE customer
SET rating = 'desired_format'
WHERE rating IN (‘incorect_format’,
                 ‘incorect_format’,
                 ‘incorect_format’)



### Missing Data 
/* checking for missing data in the film table */ 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
	COUNT(film_id) AS num_film_id,
	COUNT(title) AS num_title,
	COUNT(description) AS num_description,
	COUNT(release_year) AS num_release_yr,
	COUNT(language_id) AS num_lan_id,
	COUNT(rental_duration) AS num_rent_dur,
	COUNT(rental_rate) AS num_rent_rate,
	COUNT(length) AS num_lenth,
	COUNT(replacement_cost) AS num_replace_cost,
	COUNT(rating) AS num_rating,
	COUNT(last_update) AS num_update,
	COUNT(special_features) AS num_spec_ft,
	COUNT(fulltext) AS num_fulltxt
FROM film

/* There were no missing values in this table. If less than 5% of the values of any column were missing, I would have imputed average or mode values into the blanks. If more than 5% of the datapoints were missing from any given columns, I would have excluded the columns from analyses. */
